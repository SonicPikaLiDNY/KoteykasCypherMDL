# Some things to note:

I made this while being bored, so don't expect updates/bugfixes

it uses these 4 emoticons to encode it: :3, :P, :D and :O

# How it works:

it just finds a symbol in the js corresponding to the ones u wrote, really simple, meaning its easy to add more languages, symbols and other stuff

# Helping to add more symbols:

if you want to add more symbols either:

1. Download it [here](https://github.com/SonicPikaLiDNY/KoteykasCypherMDL/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and change the js, and host it urself

2. [Fork](https://github.com/SonicPikaLiDNY/KoteykasCypherMDL/fork) this repo and change it in ur repo, then host using GitHub pages (Mention me in ur readme or somewhere in the credits, thanks :3)

3. Download the [.js file](https://github.com/SonicPikaLiDNY/KoteykasCypherMDL/blob/main/script.js) and change it on ur device, then, send it to my [discord](https://dsc.gg/lidny) and i will add it to the website and credit you
